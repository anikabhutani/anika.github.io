                  <br>
                  <p> So I just had a thought—hear me out.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Imagine Sisyphus is really lonely when he’s pushing that rock uphill. Scratch that, he probably is. He just wants to meet people. So he took Chiron away from Camp Half-Blood in the hope that he would get to sub for him there. But no. Tantalus stole that opportunity. Now, since the gods of Olympus have zero imagining brain cells, they threw Calypso’s on an island close to Sisyphus’s mountain (I’m ignoring the fact that he’s probably in the Fields of Punishment). Calypso literally watches him try to do the same dumb thing every single day, and after Leo brought in the Fonzies, she would eat them while laughing at Sisyphus. Eventually, he finds out and is lonely again when Leo takes Calypso away. Poor guy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now about Tantalus. This guy cut his literal child up into pieces. I know, that’s dam horrible. But the gods didn’t even honor his sacrifice. They just punished him for it. Like, this means the boy’s death was in vain. Of course, I’m not saying that Tantalus was a good guy. He was horrible. But the gods could have been nicer. To the boy, not to Tantalus.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Moving on.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Tantalus has got this large tree—let’s just say it’s a mango tree. All of the Underworld gardeners are stuck tending to that one tree when they could be helping fruit trees grow in Elysium. That’s not fair to the people who actually did some good in their lives. Secondly, California is in the middle of a drought. And what did Hades do? He literally constructed a lagoon for Tantalus—who can’t even drink the water. Imagine if the “drought police” or whoever knew about this. THIS IS TREASON TO CALIFORNIA!! But then Tantalus’s punishment won’t be exactly that effective. Because he should be able to see the food and water in front of him to make him want it more. It’s what Ron Weasley says. His cousin Rachel Dare puts a slice of cake in front of him, and he wants it more than if there isn’t a cake slice in front of him. Stupid logic ;) </p>

                  <p> Okay this is weird, but I started rereading Keeper of the Lost Cities for the 3rd time in two years *yikes* What happened is, the first time I read the series, I got really sad when Fitz got mad at Sophie in the 2nd book for getting his dad's mind broken. So I stopped reading. But I reread the entire series last year, and it's so AMAZING. But, like most books I read, I forgot the plot (I remembered the main gist of it though) so I rereread (is that even a word?) it and it's still the amazing seires I remember :) I just finished the 3rd book and I'm waiting on receiving my 4th book (on hold, by the way). Yipee!

                    <p> Today, I started rereading the Maze Runner Series. It's so weird rereading something and knowing what'll happen soon. For example, in the Maze Runners, he talks about how he remembers the Glade and how that's something weird. He also remembers Teresa from somewhere. Even though most of the story is rusty in parts of my brain, I think Thomas was really involved in the planning behind the Glade and he was actually excited to go there and fix the disease thingy (I forgot the name of it hehe). As for Teresa *SPOILER* I know she dies in the 3rd book which is kinda sad but at the same time kinda relieving because doesn't she happen to be with the bad guys or something? I forgot but Thomas gets realls mad at her.

                  <p> Sometimes, I really want to go to Hogwarts. It seems so nice to get a letter and go to Diagon Alley to get things like a wand, spellbooks, potions materials, robes, and more. I would also really want an owl. And you arrive to be sorted into houses of friendly people (except perheps slytherin). After eating a luxurious feast, you are whisked away to your dormitory with nice big beds and your stuff laid out for you. And along with that, you get your very own scarf and gear from your house to cheer them on during things like Quiddich and on a daily basis. Even the classes, despite the horrendous amounts of homework, seem enjoyable. So, yeah. Hogwarts seems super nice :)
